        <h1>About LINQ</h1>

        <h2>What Is LINQ?</h2>
        <p>LINQ was created as an alternative to Quizlet that is compliant with Ohio S.B. 29, passed on October 24, 2024.</p>
        <p>LINQ is short for &quot;LINQ is not Quizlet.&quot;</p>
        <p>LINQ was created and is maintained by a UAHS student.</p>
        <p>LINQ requires no account, and does not collect or store any user data.</p>

        <h2>How to Use LINQ</h2>
        <p>LINQ currently has only one study mode: flashcards. </p>
        <p>Click or tap on a flashcard or the &quot;Flip flashcard&quot; button to see the back of the card, and use the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; buttons to navigate between the flashcards.</p>

        <h2>Creating Flashcards</h2>
        <p>Flashcards can be created by using this page.</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Important</h3>
            <p>Please note that this website is a student project, not that of a teacher or administrator. This project does not encourage students to create Quizlet accounts. This guide is intended mainly so that teachers can migrate their Quizlet sets to LINQ.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In Quizlet, go to the set that you would like to convert.</p>
        <p>Press the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select &quot;Export.&quot; This will only work if you are the owner of the set.</p>
        <p>Copy and paste the text into the box, then click &quot;Create link.&quot; Your link will appear under the button.</p>
        <textarea rows="20" id="flashcards"></textarea>
        <br>
        <button onClick="generateLink()">Create link</button>
        <p>Link to flashcards:</p>
        <div id="link"></div>

        <script>
            function generateLink() {
                let link = "https://chrispua1.github.io/LINQ/flashcards?cards=";
                let str = document.getElementById("flashcards").value.trim();
                link += encodeURIComponent(btoa(str)) + "&version=1";
                document.getElementById("link").innerHTML = "<a href=\"" + link + "\">" + link + "</a>";
            }
