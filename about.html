        <h1>About LINQ</h1>

        <h2>What Is LINQ?</h2>
        <p>LINQ was created as an alternative to Quizlet that is compliant with Ohio S.B. 29, passed on October 24, 2024. LINQ is short for &quot;LINQ is not Quizlet.&quot; LINQ was created and is maintained by a UAHS student. LINQ requires no account, and does not collect or store any user data.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How to Use LINQ</h2>
        <p>LINQ currently has only one study mode: flashcards. To use it, click or tap on a flashcard or the &quot;Flip flashcard&quot; button to see the back of the card, and use the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; buttons to navigate between the flashcards.</p>

        <h2>Creating Flashcards</h2>
        <p>Flashcards can be created by using this page.</p>

        <p>In Quizlet, go to the set that you would like to convert.</p>
        <p>Press the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select &quot;Export.&quot; This will only work if you are the owner of the set.</p>
        <p>Copy and paste the text into the box, then click &quot;Create link.&quot; Your link will appear under the button.</p>
